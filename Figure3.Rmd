title: "Figure 3"

Author network for Robert Tibshirani (author of the glmnet R package). The
figure shows that the package data extracted from CRAN represents these variations in
names as individual authors.


```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height = 10, fig.width = 15, cache = T}
load(file = "Data/saved_CRAN_snapshots/built_networks_04_04_2022.rda")

library(cranly)




plot(All_data$aut_network, author = c("Tibshirani"), exact = FALSE)


```
